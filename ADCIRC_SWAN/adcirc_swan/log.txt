 Preparing input files for subdomains.
 Select number or action:
  1. partmesh
  - partition mesh using metis ( perform this first)

  2. prepall
  - Full pre-process using default names (i.e., fort.14)

  3. prepspec
  - Full pre-process except user may specify the names
    of input files. This option also allows the user
    to skip the preprocessing of certain files.

  4. prep15
  - Localizes RunInfo (fort.15) file ONLY
    Assumes a prepall has been run previously

  5. prep13
  - Localizes NodalAttributes (fort.13) file ONLY
    Assumes a prepall has been run previously

  6. hotLocalize
  - Localizes global hotstart file ONLY

  7. hotGlobalize
  - Globalizes local hotstart files ONLY
